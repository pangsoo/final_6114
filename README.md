## Oil Price Forecast
ARIMA, LSTM, and N-HITS

**Object of the Project:** we have faced tragedies from ups and downs of cost push inflation. Those hardships are often coming in the form of daily occurencies like layoffs or divorces caused by recession or sometimes in a higher and larger level of events, wars greedy in raw materials. If we can forecast the commodities price so we prepare ourselves for upcoming turbulance, it might save us unnecessary inconveniences. The project pursues ways to better forecast the oil price which represents the raw material as a whole.
