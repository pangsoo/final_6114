## Oil Price Forecast
ARIMA, LSTM, and N-HITS

**Object of the Project** 
we have faced tragedies from ups and downs of cost push inflation. Those hardships are often coming in the form of daily occurencies like layoffs or divorces caused by recession or sometimes in a higher and larger level of events, wars greedy in raw materials. If we can forecast the commodities price so we prepare ourselves for 	upcoming turbulance, it might save us unnecessary inconveniences. The project pursues ways to better forecast the oil price which represents the raw material as a whole.

**Models** 
- ARIMA: a conventional statistical methods to handle with time-series data. A good point to start with as a baseline to gauge the performance of other algorithms
- LSTM: a deep learning model to be used in sequence prediction problems. With its feature in dealing with long-term dependencies, it is useful for times series prediction
- N-HITS: a SOTA model from N-BEATS which uses double residual stacks of full connect layers. It is proper to work on long-term forecast.
